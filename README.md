Given the opportunity to improve an already existing app, I would love to improve the notion app by allowing users to write hand written messeges
or notes within the application/page. I think this would add to the personalization of the app and cater to the users preferences. This is a
company I apsire to work with and hope my ideas can be shared with many users.
